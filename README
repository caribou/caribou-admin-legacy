## FIXME
  can't remove products from category
  backend isn't creating a new part entry on the fly
  create a new association and save the part model, without refreshing the page try to create another new association
    results in an error
  closing out of the last option in a multiple select doesn't allow the user to collapse the dropdown
    this may be a chosen bug, have to use backspace to delete the last option


## TODO
create associations on model instances
  - get it to work with habtm

  - FINISH: create a category and create a new product on the fly

      kill the inputs when an instantiated association is x'd out

      refactor and build out for new models


page tree handling, sorting, blah'ing


## NOTES

association identity
  ideally I would be able to target a field on the association when I create the link



new product on the fly
search for a product, if I can't find it, use the place holder text as a link
  the new link will open up a lightbox (ugh) with the new product form
  category selection will be disabled (have to check against the current url maybe?)

  when the form is submitted the dialog should disappear and the new id should be selected
    this will just be the illusion of a new record though
    won't actually save it to the db when the dialog is submitted
    it will have to just create the hidden fields for the new product
    then add basically a blank field to the select
    will bind events to that select to remove the hidden fields when its x'd out
