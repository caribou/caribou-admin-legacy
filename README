## FIXME -----------------------------

When trying to access a model (i.e. /newer_model)
I get a 500
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "views" does not exist


fix new models
  - Fields are not saved to model (probably due to the next item, postgres is looking for an 'undefined' id)
  - Get rid of "undefined" values in request
  - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fields' of undefined (could be related to model loading bug)
  - error: error rendering /model: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: column "undefined" does not exist
    (seems this may just be a problem with the redirect)
  - Need failure states for api requests (Also need proper status returning from the api)
  - Need to move update params to form body, can't rely on url lengths

view models
  - Model details are a little light compared to previous version
  - Edit from view doesn't work
  - Figure out wth is going on with the field rendering, it doesn't make sense and appears broken on proper

edit models
  - Edit locale_id



ensure actions work

new model

fix sorting links

if there is no view data, render blank view


# TODO

create instances of models
associations
fix model loading bug (can't go directly to /edit page)

slug field:
  - overrides the default slug
  - user can either enter free text or choose another field to slugify
  - this will slugify the value of the field chosen
  - would be cool to allow multiple field references -MW


# Questions


## UI NOTES ------------------------------

New/Edit
  - Adding fields: Better indication to rename the field, needs a pointer to indicate a click
  - Do we need Model Details on the New page?

Flash notices need to disappear


## General Notes

associations:
  collection is the has many 1..n
  part is the belongs to n..1
  link is a habtm n..n
  each of these fields needs to allow the user to override the name (think followee/follower on self-ref)
