## FIXME



## TODO
create associations on model instances
page tree handling, sorting, blah'ing

create mediator
  use that to handle model -> view interactions


## NOTES
assocations on instances
  need to pull in all instances of a model to populate the inputs
  what fields do I need to populate?
  will dynamically add fields to add as many assocs in a collection as desired
    how does this work?
    need to have a template of a field
    also need to have an "add another" button to generate another one
    indices will auto increment
    look at fields on model creation, should be able to use the same strategy

  what fields do I need to create the instance association?
  the collection assoc will have multiple sets of fields
    I need to generate those when I make a selection
  the part assoc will only have one set of fields
    these can be generated when an option is selected
  so same process for either one, except the collection may need an index
