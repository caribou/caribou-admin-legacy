## FIXME

  REMOVE ASSOCIATIONS

  closing out of the last option in a multiple select doesn't allow the user to collapse the dropdown
    this may be a chosen bug, have to use backspace to delete the last option

  !show 'part' link or name in table views



## TODO
viewspec

page tree handling, sorting, blah'ing


## NOTES
viewspecs
  create a viewspec model
  if a viewspec model exists then I can show the toggle fields button
  model has a reference to the type of view, and to the field type on the model
  +-----------+------------+
  | model_id  | view       |
  +-----------+------------+
  | 1         | 'edit'     |
  +-----------+------------+

  then each time I render a table, I have to do a lookup on that model, which means I need to load that data upfront
  there would be a custom view that has a list of all the models
    for each model the user can see a list of fields with checkboxes
    they default to shown
    e.g. Status [view] [edit] [list]

  use strategies to set defaults
