## FIXME

  REMOVE ASSOCIATIONS

  closing out of the last option in a multiple select doesn't allow the user to collapse the dropdown
    this may be a chosen bug, have to use backspace to delete the last option

  api issues:
    can't remove associations
    backend isn't creating a new part entry on the fly


  habtm bugs
    creating a new person on the fly didn't work
      (it created a new join, but with no referencing model, no errors)
    everytime I update it creates a new join
    hide join model display in edit/new form



## TODO
create associations on model instances
  - get it to work with habtm

habtm
  create two new models
  setup a 'link' between them

  what does that look like?
    on either side there will be a dropdown with the collection to associate to
    when a model is chosen, the fields are generated, all I have to do is send the id

  on the edit view
    I need to filter out the fields that don't make any sense to have, it should just render a dropdown with the model

  on the instance views
    i need to have multiple selects on either side
    hide the fields I don't need, create new instances on the fly, same as 1..n

  # QUESTIONS
  does the user care about the joins (do we want to display that model in the listings)?



page tree handling, sorting, blah'ing
