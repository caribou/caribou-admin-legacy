## FIXME

  REMOVE ASSOCIATIONS

  closing out of the last option in a multiple select doesn't allow the user to collapse the dropdown
    this may be a chosen bug, have to use backspace to delete the last option

  api issues:
    can't remove associations
    backend isn't creating a new part entry on the fly


  habtm bugs
    creating a new person on the fly didn't work
      (it created a new join, but with no referencing model, no errors)
    everytime I update it creates a new join
    hide join model display in edit/new form



## TODO
create associations on model instances
  - get it to work with habtm

page tree handling, sorting, blah'ing
