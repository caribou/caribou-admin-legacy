## TODO -----------------------------


ensure actions work
edit model: fieldsets, *fields*, hidden field
new model
render sidebar
add views to models
assocations

render footer
fix sorting links

fix routes (going straight to /models/ doesn't render anything)
breadcrumbs, fix this
if there is no view data, render blank view


## NOTE -------------

address fields have conditional values that needs to be filled in
as does boolean
assetField has an onclick event
  and a dynamic id, content
